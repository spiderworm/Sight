@document.title = Welcome to your Sight site!

<article>
	<h1>Your new Sight site is working!</h1>

	<p>Congrats!  You're almost ready to start building your cool new website!</p>

	<p>Before you run off and do that, however, there are some tests you should run to verify everything is working OK.</p>

	<section>
		<h1>Verify Routing</h1>

		<p>Routing is a very important part of the Sight framework.  You can verify it's working by checking the <a href="@site.root/routing-verification">Routing Verification</a> page.  You should see a page without errors that says something like "routing is working correctly".</p>

	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Get 'er done!</h1>

		<p>That's all the testing you have to do for now!  You should now edit this page (pages/index.html) as well as the template include (includes/template.html) to have the content you want your website to actually have!</p>
